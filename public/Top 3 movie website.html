<h1>My top three movies of all time</h1>

<h2>Order does not indicate a quality ranking</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. A Clockwork Orange</h3>
<p>A rather disturbing movie that famously caused a legal dispute with "Singing in the Rain" the musical. <br />
A brilliant investigation into what freedom of decision truly entails, and whether or not being forced to do good is truly any good.
</p>

<h3>2. Bullet Train</h3>
<p>A hilarious movie that encompasses a true "whodunnit" feeling to it. <br />
Following along a hilarious cast of individuals whom all have boarded the same train for their own motives, the mystery lies in why they've all boarded the same train however.
</p>

<h3>3. The Menu</h3>
<p>The Menu is without a doubt one of my absolute favorite Comedy Thrillers I have ever seen. <br />
Comedy, mystery, and even a bit of spine-tingling horror all combine into a wonderful package that explores the destruction of mystery wrought onto all industries as time has gone on.
